## Roots Tech Solutions: African Language NLP Corpus Project
# Overview
Roots Tech Solutions is committed to enhancing its Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for multiple African languages, particularly Swahili, Yoruba, and Amharic. The company aims to develop a comprehensive data corpus to support various NLP applications, such as semantic search, content generation, chatbot support, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.

# Business Need
The ability to process and understand Swahili, Yoruba, and Amharic text/audio accurately is critical for Roots Tech Solutions to develop innovative and competitive products. The current lack of extensive, high-quality text/audio datasets for these languages is a significant bottleneck. By collecting a vast amount of text/audio dataset from diverse online sources, the company can overcome this challenge and enhance its NLP capabilities.

# Expected Outcomes
The project is expected to deliver the following outcomes:

Data Collection and Web Scraping:

Proficiency in web scraping techniques using tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.
Expertise in identifying and extracting data from various online sources, including news websites, blogs, and social media platforms.
Programming and Development Skills:

Proficiency in Python and JavaScript (React) programming languages.
Proficiency in SQL.
Experience in developing APIs using frameworks like Flask or Django for data access and integration.
Proficiency in designing database schemas and managing structured data storage.
Experience in deploying complex software packages using Docker and Docker Compose.
Data Processing and Cleaning:

SQL and database management skills.
Knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including the use of vector databases.
Machine Learning and AI knowledge.

Objective: Establish foundational capabilities for collecting, storing, and accessing Amharic text data.

Tools: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, PostgreSQL

Implementation:

Identify Data Sources:

Research and compile a comprehensive list of Amharic-language data sources, including:
Amharic news websites (e.g., [ምልስ ፣ ማተሚያ ቤት አጽናፊ], [አዲስ አድማስ], [ፀሐይ ምክር])
Amharic blogs and forums
Amharic social media platforms (e.g., [ፌስቡክ], [ትዊተር])
Other relevant online sources of Amharic text data
Web Scraping:

Develop a web scraping pipeline using a combination of tools, such as Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium, to extract Amharic text data from the identified sources.
Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliable data collection.
Ensure that the scraping process adheres to the terms of service and robots.txt guidelines of the target websites.
Data Storage:

Design a PostgreSQL database schema to store the collected Amharic text data in a structured format.
Consider including metadata fields, such as source URL, publication date, author (if available), and any other relevant information.
Implement efficient data ingestion and storage processes to handle the expected volume of data.
Data Validation and Monitoring:

Implement data validation checks to ensure the integrity and quality of the collected Amharic text data.
Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect and address any issues with the data collection and storage processes.
Documentation and Deployment:

Document the data collection and storage processes, including the list of data sources, scraping scripts, and database schema.
Containerize the data collection and storage components using Docker and Docker Compose to facilitate easy deployment and scalability.
Develop a deployment pipeline to automate the provisioning and updating of the data collection and storage infrastructure.
